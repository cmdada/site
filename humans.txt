/* VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE */
If you find a vulnerability, don't be a jerk about it. Instead, consider this:
If you're reading this, you're probably thinking, 'I'm going to find a vulnerability and make myself famous.' But here's the thing; nobody cares about this site
So, if you're thinking about exploiting this site and pwning the world, remember:
- You're not saving the world.
- You're not making a difference.
- You're just proving that you can find a loophole in a site quick site i wrote to be fun
Instead, why not use your skills to do something constructive? Like, I don't know, contributing to open-source projects or helping out in a community that actually needs your help.
