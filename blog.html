        <h1>So what's up with transcode on the aur?</h1>
        <p>As the title may suggest, https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/transcode has something weird going on with its packagebase.</p>
        <p>The website previously displayed for the upstream url seems to not be in the ownership of the maintainer, or if it is, it has been repurposed as an unrelated blog about apple cider vinegar, and the package previously used a Github clone (https://github.com/wyyrepo/transcode) That isnʼt from the original author, but the tree is identical to whatʼs hosted on the aur, except that the GitHub version has a README.md instead of a README.</p>
        <p>So basically I'm just confused about what happened there and wanted to talk about it somewhere. Oh and its not some random irrelevant packagee, kde-services depends on it.</p>
